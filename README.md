# Follow Along Links

---

## The "Follow-Along-Links" project is one of the challenges in the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 course. The project involves creating a web page with a navigation menu that includes links to various sections of the page. When a user clicks on one of the links, the page should smoothly scroll to the appropriate section.

The challenge requires students to write JavaScript code that listens for click events on the links, prevents the default behavior of the link (i.e. navigating to a new page), and instead animates the page's scroll position using the window.scrollTo() method or the newer window.scroll() method.

The project also involves creating a fixed position navigation bar that stays visible at the top of the screen as the user scrolls through the page. This requires some CSS styling to position the navbar and ensure that it doesn't overlap with other page content.

Overall, the Follow-Along-Links project is a great exercise for students looking to improve their JavaScript and CSS skills, and to learn how to create smooth and intuitive navigation on a web page.
